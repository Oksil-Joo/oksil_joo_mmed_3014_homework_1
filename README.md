# MULTI-PAGE PHP SITE

This is a multi-page PHP site that lists my portfolio work data and includes a contact form that sends an email with the information you enter.

### Project description
1. Main page: Reuse common pieces of markup/ HTML in Navigation and Footer.
2. Listing page: Display a list of my working file that comes from an array
3. Contact page: Checks the information before capturing a user's name, email, and message and sending it to you an email.
4. Submit with my Github repository in the submission box on FOL
